QGIS Sponsor Guide
==================

QGIS is an entirely Open Source project. QGIS development is carried out
largely by a group of volunteers, that in time have built up a large, valuable
and useful code base, free to use and improve for everybody. As a result, you
have free access to the source code and binaries that we provide on our web
site. As a result of this volunteer approach, a number of tasks, less
interesting or important for the developers, are sometimes left behind. In
addition, promoting QGIS requires our participation at congresses and
conferences and the production of information material, sometimes very
expensive for volunteer developers.

Meanwhile, many organizations have made an investment in using QGIS as part of
their operations, but have not had a way to directly contribute to the success
and long-term health of the project.

We would like to extend our activities and improve the quality of QGIS. Your
financial contribution will support the maintenance, improvement, and promotion
of QGIS. Sponsorship is not a way for individuals to control the development of
the project, but rather a way of ensuring the longevity and overall health of
the project.

With your donations we were able to fund several developer meetings, starting
from that in Vienna, autumn 2009. Users donations, with the co-sponsoring of
the Italian GFOSS.it association allow us to fund travel and accommodation
costs of several key developers.

Donations thus contributed effectively to the great success of the meeting (see
e.g. a report).

We encourage you to donate again to the upcoming developer meetings.
How can you support the QGIS Development

There are two kinds of financial contributions, we accept: sponsorships: a
sponsorship is an annual commitment of funds to the project.  donation: a
donation is a once off financial contribution to the QGIS project.  

Sponsorship
...........

Sponsors can sponsor Quantum GIS for any amount of money of at least 500 €/700
US$. Sponsorships last one year, after which they may be continued with a new
payment, or allowed to lapse. At or above the following levels a sponsor will
be designated as being one of the following class:

======= ========== =================
Euros   US Dollars Sponsorship Level
======= ========== =================
27,000+ €/39,000 US$: Platinum Sponsor
9,000+ €/13,000 US$: Gold Sponsor
3,000+ €/4,300 US$: Silver Sponsor
500+ €/700 US$: Bronze Sponsor
======= ========== =================

Donation
........

Donations can be of any amount, through the Make A Donation PayPal link
provided in the left-hand menu of this website or through our bank account
(write us for details: cavallini at faunalia dot it). Even a small donation can
make a big difference and help to reach important project goals!

If you wish to send us a larger donation, you are strongly encouraged to use
the bank account rather than PayPal.

What is your benefit sponsoring the QGIS Development?
-----------------------------------------------------

Sponsoring the Quantum GIS project provides the following benefits:

* Ensures the sustainability and health of the QGIS project.
* All sponsors will be listed on the project sponsor page, ordered by
  contribution class (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze) with a link back to the
  sponsor.
* Platinum Sponsors will have their logo placed on rotating banner on front
  page of qgis.osgeo.org
* Gold Sponsors will be listed on the sponsors page with a large logo (e.g.
  300x200px)
* Silver sponsors will be listed on the sponsors page with a medium size logo
  (e.g. 150x100px)
* Bronze sponsors will be listed on the sponsors page with a small size logo
  (e.g. 64x64px)
* Sponsors will be listed in the front matter of the QGIS manual
* Sponsors will be allowed to use a special version of the QGIS logo on their
  web site and promotional materials, which shows they are a sponsor of the
  QGIS project
* Donors will be listed on the sponsors page, but do not receive the additional
  benefits listed above for sponsors
* No advertising will be placed within the QGIS application itself.


How do we use financial support?
--------------------------------
The sponsorship funds will be spent to directly improve the code base of the
project, to fund tasks that generally receive less attention from developers,
and to fund work on peripheral project tasks so that core contributors can
focus efforts on QGIS improvements. As an example, we would like to fund the
following project activities:

* fund developers to work on specific aspects of QGIS including implementing
  new features and fixing bugs
* an annual QGIS Developer Meeting where we can meet in person and brainstorm,
  fix bugs and hold a week of intensive QGIS development work. Most QGIS
  developers will happily donate their time to such events, but we are looking
  for sponsors to cover travel, accommodation and subsistence costs for these
  events.
* attendance to other conferences. There are several high profile conferences
  held each year (such as the http://www.foss4g.org), and we would like to be
  able to fund QGIS team members to represent QGIS at important conferences, to
  promote it among users and raise interest and solicit code contributions from
  other developers.
* Decisions on spending of sponsorship funds will be made by the QGIS Project
  Steering Committee.

.. note:: We regret that we cannot accept 'earmarked' funding as it creates
    many administrative issues. If you are interested in funding specific aspects
    of QGIS development, we encourage you to allocate additional human resources to
    the project, e.g. hiring a developer, or participating to our bug fixing
    initiative.


Organizations or individuals interested in sponsoring the QGIS project should

arrangements.
