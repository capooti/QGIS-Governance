Limitations for Sponsors
------------------------

As a gold sponsor we feel it only fair that you receive conspicuous
recognition for your contribution to the project and we will do this
to the best of our abilities.

However there are some restrictions, both from a practical
and an ethical point of view of what we can offer that have some
bearing on your draft document.

QGIS has a policy of providing a 'clean application'. Over the years
we have had a great many contributors to the project, both in their
personal and in an institutional capacity. From time to time we get
requests to include logos, about dialogs etc within the application to
recognise these contributions. As you can well imagine, if we agreed
to every one of these, the application would be extremely cluttered
and visually noisy. Instead we try to offer a number of centralised
places where these contributors can be acknowledged, as listed above.
