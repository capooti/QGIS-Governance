     -  We would like to thank GFOSS.it, the Italian Free and Open Source
        Software organisation for the continual sponsorship they provide to the
        QGIS project. This sponsorship is in the form of both financial support
        (at around 1,500 Euros annually) and project administration support in
        the form of financial services. Visit GFOSS.it for more information
        about the work they do (site mainly in Italian).
